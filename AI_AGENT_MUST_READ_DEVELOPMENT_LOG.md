## ✅ [COMPLETED CHANGES]

### **January 21, 2025 - Remove Redundant Babel Plugin**
**Agent**: AI Development Agent  
**Request**: Remove redundant @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object to eliminate deprecated warnings

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ **Removed**: `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object@^7.21.11` from devDependencies
- ✅ **Reasoning**: Plugin already included by react-scripts internally (duplicate dependency)
- ✅ **Reinstalled**: Dependencies automatically updated (13.15 seconds)
- ✅ **Verified**: Build process works correctly (76.95 kB gzipped maintained)
- ✅ **Tested**: Frontend service restarted successfully

**Updated package.json devDependencies**:
```json
{
  "autoprefixer": "^10.4.20",
  "postcss": "^8.4.49", 
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17"
}
```

**Impact**: Eliminated redundant Babel plugin, should reduce deprecated warnings during npm/yarn installs
