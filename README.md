# Mega Meng - Full-Stack Web Application

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Mega Meng** is a clean, modern full-stack web application built with React frontend and FastAPI backend. The project features a **dual-application architecture** with **Yuzha Launcher** as the primary app and **WarungMeng** as an independent business website.

## 🚀 **Current Live Status (Updated)**

### **Primary Application: Yuzha Launcher**
- **Main Route (/)**: Professional application launcher with modern UI
- **Live on Netlify**: https://mega-meng.netlify.app (Shows Yuzha Launcher)
- **Features**: Fast Launch, Smart Control, Easy Setup interfaces
- **Design**: Blue-to-purple gradient with glassmorphism effects

---

## 🏆 What Has Been Achieved

### ✅ **Repository Cleanup & Foundation**
- **Started with**: Complex launcher/clock system with TypeScript errors and React infinite loops
- **Cleaned to**: Minimal, error-free foundation with React + Flask + MongoDB setup
- **Removed**: 50+ complex files, fixed all compilation errors, eliminated infinite loops
- **Result**: Clean, professional foundation ready for any type of development

### ✅ **Full-Stack Architecture Deployed**
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Flask API with CORS configuration
- **Database**: Ready for MongoDB integration
- **All services**: Successfully deployed and working

### ✅ **Multi-Platform Deployment**
- **Frontend**: Deployed to Netlify with auto-deploy from GitHub
- **Backend**: Deployed to PythonAnywhere (free tier)
- **Domain Strategy**: Setup for both personal app and public website
- **Auto-Updates**: Automatic deployment on every GitHub push

## 🌐 Live URLs & Access

### **Production URLs:**
- **Frontend (Web App)**: https://mega-meng.netlify.app
- **Backend (API)**: https://yuzhayo.pythonanywhere.com/api/
- **API Health Check**: https://yuzhayo.pythonanywhere.com/api/health
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/yuzhayo/mega-meng

### **Domain Strategy:**
- `mega-meng.netlify.app` → Personal web application (LIVE)
- `warungmang.com` → Future public website (Hostinger domain reserved)
- Both can use the same backend API for data sharing

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### **Making Updates:**

#### **Frontend Changes:**
1. **Edit code** in this development environment or GitHub
2. **Push to main branch** → `git push origin main`
3. **Netlify auto-deploys** in 2-3 minutes
4. **Live at** https://mega-meng.netlify.app

#### **Backend Changes:**
1. **Login to PythonAnywhere** (username: yuzhayo)
2. **Edit** `/home/yuzhayo/mega-meng/flask_server.py`
3. **Save changes** and click **Reload** in Web tab
4. **Live immediately** at https://yuzhayo.pythonanywhere.com

#### **Local Development:**
1. **Frontend**: `cd frontend && yarn start` (port 3000)
2. **Backend**: `cd backend && python server.py` (port 8001)  
3. **Test changes** before pushing to production
