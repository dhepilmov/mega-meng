## REPOSITORY CLEANED TO FOUNDATION

**Status**: Repository successfully cleaned to basic full-stack foundation

**Cleanup Summary**:
- ✅ Removed complex launcher/clock system
- ✅ Removed all TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Removed React infinite loop issues
- ✅ Cleaned unnecessary dependencies
- ✅ Simplified to basic React + FastAPI + MongoDB foundation

**Current Foundation**:
- **Backend**: Clean FastAPI server with MongoDB connection
  - Basic API routes: GET /api/ and GET /api/health
  - CORS properly configured
  - Environment variables intact
- **Frontend**: Simple React app with Tailwind CSS
  - Clean welcome page
  - TypeScript support
  - React Router ready
  - No complex components or logic

**What's Available Now**:
- Working full-stack foundation
- Clean localhost interface showing welcome page
- Ready for new feature development
- All configuration files preserved (Tailwind, TypeScript, etc.)
